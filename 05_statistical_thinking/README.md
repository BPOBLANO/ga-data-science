## Objectives

By the end of the session, you should be able to:

* Describe the difference between probability theory and statistics
* Define confidence intervals and *p*-values
* Use `scipy` and `statsmodels` to set up and run hypothesis tests

## Plan

The session is designed to be delivered over three hours (including breaks).
