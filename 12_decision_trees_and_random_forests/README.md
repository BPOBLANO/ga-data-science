## Objectives

By the end of the session, you should be able to:

* Describe the main differences and similarities between decision trees and random forests
* Define bagging and boosting
* Use `scikit-learn` to fit decision trees and random forests

## Plan

The session is designed to be delivered over three hours (including breaks).
