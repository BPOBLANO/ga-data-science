## Objectives

By the end of the session, you should be able to:

* Describe the main differences between bagging, boosting and stacking
* Explain why ensembles achieve higher accuracy than individual predictors
* Use `scikit-learn` and XGBoost to fit boosted models

## Plan

The session is designed to be delivered over three hours (including breaks).
